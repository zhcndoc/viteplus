# listing

A bare app command at a workspace root without an interactive terminal prints
the ranked package listing with -C hints and exits 1 instead of building the
root (rfcs/cwd-flag.md).

## `vp build`

**Exit code:** 1

```
note: You are running `vp build` as a Vite+ built-in command. If you meant to run the build npm script, use `vpr build` instead.
error: `vp build` at the workspace root needs a target package.

  Packages in this workspace:
    admin             apps/admin
    web               apps/web
    ui                packages/ui
    app-root-listing  .

  Pass a directory:  vp -C apps/admin build
  Or run every package's build script:  vp run -r build
```

## `vp dev`

dev at the root no longer starts a server against the root

**Exit code:** 1
