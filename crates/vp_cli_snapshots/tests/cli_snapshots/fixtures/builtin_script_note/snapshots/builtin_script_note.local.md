## `vp dev --port 12312312312`

`vp dev` points at the `dev` script (invalid port exits the server immediately)

**Exit code:** 1

```
note: You are running `vp dev` as a Vite+ built-in command. If you meant to run the dev npm script, use `vpr dev` instead.
error when starting dev server:
Error: No available ports found between 12312312312 and 65535
```

## `vp build`

`vp build` points at the same build script used by the suppression cases

```
note: You are running `vp build` as a Vite+ built-in command. If you meant to run the build npm script, use `vpr build` instead.

## `vp lint src/`

every built-in that can be mistaken for a script gets the same note

```
note: You are running `vp lint` as a Vite+ built-in command. If you meant to run the lint npm script, use `vpr lint` instead.

## `cd src && vp lint .`

note reaches the enclosing package from a subdirectory, like `vpr` does

```
note: You are running `vp lint` as a Vite+ built-in command. If you meant to run the lint npm script, use `vpr lint` instead.

## `vp format src/`

the `format` alias reaches the local CLI as typed, so its own script gets the note

```
note: You are running `vp format` as a Vite+ built-in command. If you meant to run the format npm script, use `vpr format` instead.
Finished in <duration> on 1 files using <n> threads.
```

## `vp fmt src/`

no note: only `format` is a script here, and that is not the name this ran under

```
Finished in <duration> on 1 files using <n> threads.
```

## `vp help dev`

the local path checks the original `help` spelling; the global CLI renders help before local delegation

## `vp preview --port 12312312312`

no note: this project has no `preview` script

**Exit code:** 1

error when starting preview server:
Error: No available ports found between 12312312312 and 65535
```

## `vp lint src/`

the note still reaches piped output, such as an AI agent capturing the command; it goes to stderr, so parsed stdout stays intact
