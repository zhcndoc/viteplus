VITE+ - The Unified Toolchain for the Web

✓ Node.js and package-manager management set to system-first.

Selected commands and shims will now prefer system tools, falling back to managed tools.

Run `vp env on` to always use Vite+ managed tools.

Cleanup removes user data and leaves the Homebrew package installed

```
✓ Vite+ removed 3 shims from <workspace>/home/bin
✓ Removed <workspace>/home

✓ Vite+ removed its managed files and shell entries from your system.
note: The Homebrew package remains installed. Run `brew uninstall vite-plus` to remove it.
note: To run `vp` again, restart your terminal or run `hash -r` in Bash. The remaining Homebrew package will start setup again.
note: Restart your terminal to apply shell changes.
