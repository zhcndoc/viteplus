//! PGP signature verification for runtime checksum files.
//!
//! Node.js signs its `SHASUMS256.txt` with the PGP key of the releaser who cut
//! the release (see <https://github.com/nodejs/node#verifying-binaries>). This
//! module verifies the clearsigned `SHASUMS256.txt.asc` against an embedded copy
//! of the Node.js release signing keys before any checksum from it is trusted,
//! so a tampered or attacker-controlled SHASUMS file cannot pass off a malicious
//! archive whose hash it also controls.
//!
//! The trusted keys are vendored from the [`nodejs/release-keys`] repository.
//! They currently only cover Node.js; when another runtime gains signature
//! support, the embedded keyring and [`verify_signed_shasums`] should be
//! generalized to take the relevant keys.
//!
//! # Trust model and limitations
//!
//! The trust boundary is the curated set of Node.js release keys plus honoring
//! key/subkey revocation, which is what `gpgv` against the release keyring
//! provides. Three properties follow from that model and are intentional:
//!
//! - **Key expiry is not enforced.** `gpgv` treats an expired key as advisory
//!   and still reports its signatures as good (verified: it exits 0 for a real
//!   release signed shortly after its key's expiry, e.g. `node-v16.20.0`).
//!   Enforcing expiry would reject such legitimate releases. It would also not
//!   add protection against a leaked key, because the attacker controls the
//!   signature's self-asserted creation time and can backdate a forgery. The
//!   real protection against a compromised key is its revocation (enforced
//!   here) plus keeping the vendored keyring current.
//! - **The keyring is a vendored snapshot.** Node version resolution is live, so
//!   a release signed by a releaser key added after this snapshot was built has
//!   no matching trusted key and fails closed on the official source until the
//!   keyring (and `vite-plus`) is updated. The current releasers' keys are
//!   included, so this only affects brand-new releasers; the keyring must be
//!   refreshed from [`nodejs/release-keys`] as the releaser set changes.
//!
