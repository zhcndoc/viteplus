//! Centralized environment variable name constants.
//!
//! Every vite-plus-specific environment variable is defined here as a `&str`
//! constant. Using these constants instead of string literals ensures:
//!
//! - **Single source of truth** — each name defined once.
//! - **Compile-time typo detection** — a misspelled constant name won't compile.
//! - **Easy discoverability** — grep this file to see all env vars.
//!
//! Standard system variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `CI`, etc.) are intentionally
//! excluded — they're well-known and benefit less from constant definitions.
//! The `XDG_*_HOME` base-directory variables are the exception: they
//! participate in `VpDirs` path resolution, so they get constants too.
