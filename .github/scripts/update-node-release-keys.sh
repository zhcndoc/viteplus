# Regenerate the vendored Node.js release signing keyring from the canonical
# nodejs/release-keys repository.
#
# The keyring is the trust anchor used by `vite_js_runtime` to verify the PGP
# signature on Node.js `SHASUMS256.txt` (see rfcs/verify-node-shasums-signature.md).
# Run from the repository root:
#
#   .github/scripts/update-node-release-keys.sh
#
# When KEYRING_SUMMARY_FILE is set, a Markdown pull-request body describing the
# before/after key changes (added, removed, modified, by fingerprint) is written
# to that path. The accompanying workflow
# (.github/workflows/update-node-release-keys.yml) runs this weekly and opens a
# PR when the keyring changes. The change must be reviewed by a human before
# merging, since it alters which keys are trusted.
