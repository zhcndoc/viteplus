# Contributing Guide

## Initial Setup

### macOS / Linux

You'll need the following tools installed on your system:

```
brew install pnpm node just cmake
```

Install Rust & Cargo using rustup:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
```

Initial setup to install dependencies for Vite+:

```
just init
```

### Windows

You'll need the following tools installed on your system. You can use [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/).

```powershell
winget install pnpm.pnpm OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS Casey.Just Kitware.CMake
```

Install Rust & Cargo from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/), then install `cargo-binstall`:

```powershell
cargo install cargo-binstall
```

Initial setup to install dependencies for Vite+:

```powershell
just init
```

**Note:** Run commands in PowerShell or Windows Terminal. Some commands may require elevated permissions.

## Build Vite+ and upstream dependencies

To create a release build of Vite+ and all upstream dependencies, run:

```
just build
```

## Install the Vite+ Global CLI from source code

```
pnpm bootstrap-cli
vp --version
```

This builds all packages, compiles the Rust `vp` binary, and installs the CLI to `~/.vite-plus`.

## Validate the local build against a real project

Unit and snap tests don't cover everything. Interactive flows in particular (prompts, pickers, scaffolding) are easiest to validate by running your work-in-progress CLI inside a real Vite+ project.

First, understand how `vp` picks which `vite-plus` to run: for JS-backed commands (such as `vp create`), the global `vp` binary resolves `vite-plus` from the project's `node_modules` first and only falls back to the global installation in `~/.vite-plus`. If your test project has `vite-plus` installed from npm, `pnpm bootstrap-cli` alone will not make it run your local code.

Build the local CLI package after each change:

```bash
pnpm -F vite-plus build      # TypeScript + native NAPI binding
pnpm -F vite-plus build-ts   # faster, when only TypeScript changed
```

### `pnpm link` the local package

Link your checkout into the test project. The global `vp` then delegates to the project-local CLI, and re-entrant `vp` sub-commands (for example `vp create` running `vp install` and `vp fmt` after scaffolding) resolve back to the same linked checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/test-project
pnpm link /path/to/vite-plus/packages/cli

vp create   # now runs your local checkout
```

Verify the link with `ls -l node_modules/vite-plus` (it should be a symlink into your checkout). Notes:

- pnpm records the link as a `vite-plus: link:...` override (in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for workspace projects, otherwise under `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json`), so it survives later installs. Don't commit that override in the test project.
- `pnpm link` may also add a `packageManager` field to the test project's `package.json`; revert it if unwanted.
- Undo with `pnpm unlink vite-plus`, or remove the override and run `pnpm install`.

### Global CLI (Rust) changes

`pnpm link` only swaps the JS side; the `vp` binary on `PATH` (and the Rust-backed commands it handles directly, such as package-manager commands) is still whatever is installed in `~/.vite-plus`. For changes to the Rust global CLI (`crates/`), install it from source, and combine with `pnpm link` when the change spans both layers:

```bash
pnpm bootstrap-cli
vp --version
```

## Workflow for build and test

You can run this command to build, test and check if there are any snapshot changes:

```
pnpm bootstrap-cli && pnpm test && git status
```

## Running Snap Tests

Snap tests verify CLI output. They are located in `packages/cli/snap-tests/` (local CLI) and `packages/cli/snap-tests-global/` (global CLI).

```bash
# Run all snap tests (local + global)
pnpm -F vite-plus snap-test

# Run only local CLI snap tests
pnpm -F vite-plus snap-test-local
pnpm -F vite-plus snap-test-local <name-filter>

# Run only global CLI snap tests
pnpm -F vite-plus snap-test-global
pnpm -F vite-plus snap-test-global <name-filter>
```

Snap tests auto-generate `snap.txt` files. Check `git diff` to verify output changes are correct.

## Verified Commits

All commits in PR branches should be GitHub-verified so reviewers can confirm commit authenticity.

Set up local commit signing and GitHub verification first:

- Follow GitHub's guide for GPG commit signature verification: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#gpg-commit-signature-verification
- If you use Graphite, add the Graphite GPG key to your GitHub account from the Graphite UI as well, otherwise commits updated by Graphite won't show as verified.

After setup, re-sign any existing commits in your branch so the full branch is verified:

```bash
# Re-sign each commit on your branch (replace origin/main with your branch base if needed)
git rebase -i origin/main
# At each stop:
git commit --amend --date=now --no-edit -S
# Then continue:
git rebase --continue
```

When done, force-push the updated branch history:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Pull upstream dependencies

> [!NOTE]
>
> Upstream dependencies only need to be updated when an ["upgrade upstream dependencies"](https://github.com/voidzero-dev/vite-plus/pulls?q=is%3Apr+feat%28deps%29%3A+upgrade+upstream+dependencies+merged) pull request is merged.

To sync the latest upstream dependencies such as Rolldown and Vite, run:

```
pnpm tool sync-remote
just build
```

## macOS Performance Tip

If you are using macOS, add your terminal app (Ghostty, iTerm2, Terminal, …) to the approved "Developer Tools" apps in the Privacy panel of System Settings and restart your terminal app. Your Rust builds will be about ~30% faster.
