/// ## Parameters
///
/// - `options`: Configuration for the command to run, including:

///   - `args`: Command line arguments
///   - `envs`: Environment variables
///   - `cwd`: Working directory
///
/// ## Returns
///
/// Returns a `RunCommandResult` containing:
/// - The exit code of the command
/// - A map of file paths accessed and their access modes
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```javascript
/// const result = await runCommand({
///   binName: "node",
///   args: ["-p", "console.log('hello')"],
///   envs: { PATH: process.env.PATH },
///   cwd: "/tmp"
/// });
/// console.log(`Exit code: ${result.exitCode}`);
/// console.log(`Path accesses:`, result.pathAccesses);
