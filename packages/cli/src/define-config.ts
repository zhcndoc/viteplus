/**
 * Rescue `vitest` / `@vitest/*` resolution for browser-mode tests.
 *
 * In an established project that depends only on `vite-plus`, both `vitest`
 * and `@vitest/browser` are transitive deps. pnpm's isolated layout only
 * exposes a package's *direct* deps, so the browser-mode Vite dev server
 * (rooted at the consumer project) cannot resolve `vitest/internal/browser`,
 * `@vitest/expect`, etc. Non-browser tests are unaffected — vitest's own
 * module runner handles resolution there.
 *
 * This plugin re-resolves the `vitest` / `@vitest/*` family through Vite's OWN
 * resolver, but ROOTED at `vite-plus`'s location ([[vitePlusModuleFile]]) and
 * then the bundled `vitest`'s location ([[getVitestAnchor]]) BEFORE the
 * project. So every such import binds to the same physical (pinned) Vitest that
 * `vp test` spawns as the runner (see `resolveBundled` in `resolve-test.ts`)
 * and that the `vite-plus/test*` shims re-export. Were a project-local Vitest
 * preferred instead, a project that keeps its own `vitest` dependency would
 * split the run across two physical Vitest module instances — the runner
 * (bundled) vs. the test files' `vi`/`expect`/runner internals (project) — a
 * classic source of internal-state and mock-hoisting mismatches. For the common
 * migrated layout (a project depending only on `vite-plus`) nothing in this
 * family is resolvable from the project root under pnpm's isolated layout
 * anyway, so default resolution would return `null` there regardless;
 * bundle-first only changes the project-keeps-its-own-`vitest` case, which is
 * exactly the case we want pinned.
 *
 * Resolution goes through `this.resolve` (NOT [[vitePlusRequire]].resolve) so
 * Vite's ESM export conditions are honoured: a raw `require.resolve` would pick
 * Vitest's CJS `require`-condition entry — a throw-stub for the bare `vitest`
 * root (`index.cjs`), and the CJS build for subpaths (e.g. `vitest/config` →
 * `config.cjs`) instead of the ESM entry. Two bundled anchors are tried because `@vitest/browser*` are
 * direct deps of `vite-plus` (reachable from [[vitePlusModuleFile]]) while the
 * nested `@vitest/*` family are deps of `vitest` (reachable only from the
 * `vitest` anchor). The project root remains the last resort for any family id
 * the bundled tree cannot resolve, so this is never worse than deferring first.
 *
 * Two intentional limits of routing through `this.resolve`:
 *   - An EXPLICIT project `resolve.alias` / `resolve.dedupe` on the vitest
 *     family takes precedence (Vite's pipeline applies it even from a bundled
 *     anchor). Neither is set by default in Vitest 4.x, so this only affects
 *     projects that deliberately re-point the family — treated as an opt-out of
 *     pinning, not defeated silently.
 *   - Coverage providers (`@vitest/coverage-v8` / `-istanbul`) are NOT shipped
 *     with `vite-plus`, so they hit the project fallback below. Under
 *     `--coverage`, a project-installed provider of a different version pairs
 *     with the bundled runner; Vitest only WARNS on the version skew and then
 *     runs mixed versions (its provider `_initialize` logs and continues, it
 *     does not throw), which silently yields unreliable coverage — so
 *     [[vitePlusCoverageVersionGuardPlugin]] fails fast on a mismatch instead.

 * project's `include` glob never get the vitest resolver / auto-inline plugins.
 *
 * Entry shapes (from `TestProjectConfiguration`):
 *   - string  (glob path like `'./packages/*'`)  → passed through unchanged.
 *   - object  (inline config with `test: {...}`) → clone and prepend plugin.
 *   - function (sync or async)                   → wrap so its result is injected.
 *   - Promise (resolves to inline config)        → chain `.then(injectPlugin)`.
 *
 * String/glob entries cannot be cloned, so they carry no injected plugin. This
 * only weakens the COVERAGE guard, and only narrowly: coverage is global, and
 * the migration rewrites every nested config file to vite-plus
 * `defineConfig`/`defineProject` (which re-inject the guard), so a migrated
 * workspace still fires it from its resolved projects. The residual gap is a
 * hand-authored workspace whose string globs resolve to raw `vitest/config`
 * sub-configs or bare directory projects — there a provider/runner skew falls
 * back to Vitest's own (softer) warning instead of the guard's hard error.
