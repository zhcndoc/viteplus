# CLI Package Build Architecture

This document explains how `vite-plus` is built and how it re-exports from `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` (bundled vite/rolldown/tsdown) and from upstream `vitest` to serve as a drop-in replacement for `vite`.

## Overview

The CLI package uses a **4-step build process**:

1. **tsdown Build** - Bundle all CLI entry points via tsdown
2. **NAPI Binding Build** - Compile Rust code to native Node.js bindings
3. **Core Package Export Sync** - Re-export `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` under `./client`, `./types/*`, etc.
4. **Test Package Export Sync** - Re-export upstream `vitest` under `./test/*`

This architecture allows users to import everything from a single package (`vite-plus`) as a drop-in replacement for `vite`, without needing to know about the separate `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` bundle or `vitest`.

## Core Dependency Identity

The CLI declares its core dependency as `vite`, using
`workspace:@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core@*` in the workspace and an exact npm
alias in packed releases. Runtime imports and generated shims use `vite` and
its subpaths. This gives the CLI and plugins the same dependency name and
avoids separate core instances under the alias and canonical package name.

`resolve-core.ts` resolves the alias from the selected CLI package and checks
its core version. It also checks any Vite dependency declared by the command's
target project. An incidental hoisted peer does not trigger project validation.
These checks run before Vite or packaging commands start. Keep the canonical
name in release metadata and alias targets to identify the published package.

For npm projects without overrides, pin a declared `vite` alias to the exact
installed `vite-plus` version. npm can replace a tagged alias such as
`npm:@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core@latest` with upstream Vite to satisfy Vitest's
peer range. The CLI rejects that mismatch and directs users to `vp migrate`,
which writes an exact alias and the package-manager overrides. The npm fixtures
check shared core identity with an exact alias and rejection of the tagged layout.

## Build Steps

### Step 1: tsdown Build (`buildWithTsdown`)

Bundles all CLI entry points using tsdown (configured in `tsdown.config.ts`). The config defines two builds:

**ESM build** — bundles all entry points to `dist/`:

- Public API entries: `bin`, `index`, `define-config`, `fmt`, `lint`, `pack`, `pack-bin`
- Global command entries: `create`, `migrate`, `version`, `config`, `hooks`, `mcp`, `staged`
- All third-party dependencies are inlined at build time
- Only packages that must be resolved at runtime stay external (NAPI binding, `vite`, `vitest`, `oxfmt`, `oxlint`)
- Code splitting creates shared chunks for code used by multiple entries
- DTS (`.d.ts`) files are generated for all entries

**CJS build** — produces dual-format output for:

- `define-config.ts` → `dist/define-config.cjs`
- `index.cts` → `dist/index.cjs`

**Input**: `src/**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.cts`
**Output**: `dist/*.js`, `dist/*.cjs`, `dist/*.d.ts`, `dist/*-<hash>.js` (shared chunks)

### Step 2: NAPI Binding Build (`buildNapiBinding`)

Builds native Rust bindings using `@napi-rs/cli`:

```typescript
const cli = new NapiCli();
await cli.build({
  packageJsonPath: '../package.json',
  cwd: 'binding',
  platform: true,
  release: process.env.VP_CLI_DEBUG !== '1',
  esm: true,
});
```

**Input**: `binding/*.rs` (Rust source)
**Output**: `binding/*.node` (platform-specific binaries)

The build generates platform-specific native binaries and formats the generated JavaScript wrapper with `oxfmt`.

### Step 3: Core Package Export Sync (`syncCorePackageExports`)

Creates shim files that re-export from `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core`, enabling this package to be a drop-in replacement for upstream `vite`. This is critical for compatibility with existing Vite plugins and configurations.

**Prerequisites**: The core package must be built first (its `dist/vite/` directory must exist). See [Core Package Bundling](../core/BUNDLING.md) for details on how the core package bundles vite, rolldown, and tsdown.

**Export paths created**:

| Export Path          | Type       | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./client`           | Types only | Triple-slash reference for ambient type declarations (CSS modules, asset imports, etc.) |
| `./module-runner`    | JS + Types | Re-exports the Vite module runner for SSR/environments                                  |
| `./internal`         | JS + Types | Re-exports internal Vite APIs                                                           |
| `./dist/client/*`    | JS         | Client runtime files (`.mjs`, `.cjs`)                                                   |
| `./types/*`          | Types only | Type-only re-exports using `export type *`                                              |
| `./types/internal/*` | Blocked    | Set to `null` to prevent access to internal types                                       |

**Shim file examples**:

```typescript
// dist/client.d.ts (triple-slash reference for ambient types)
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

// dist/module-runner.js
export * from 'vite/module-runner';

// dist/types/importMeta.d.ts (type-only export)
export type * from 'vite/types/importMeta.d.ts';
```

**Note on export ordering**: In `package.json`, the `./types/internal/*` export (set to `null`) must appear before `./types/*` for correct precedence. More specific patterns must precede wildcards.

### Step 4: Test Package Export Sync (`syncTestPackageExports`)

Reads Vitest's exports plus the Playwright and Preview provider packages and creates re-export shims under `./test/*`.

Ship `vite` as a dependency alias for the same `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` version. Vitest v5 requires a `vite` peer. Yarn users must be able to install `vite-plus` without adding `vite` or `vitest` to their project. Keep the alias in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`.

The main surface mirrors Vitest `5.0.1`, except for package metadata and wildcard
exports. Export tests snapshot the final keys. Vite+ 1.0 removes the legacy
`coverage`, `reporters`, `environments`, and `snapshot` aliases under
`vite-plus/test/`. Run `vp migrate` to replace imports from either `vitest/*`
or `vite-plus/test/*` with the `node` or `runtime` entry:

| Removed path suffix        | Replacement              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `coverage`, `reporters`    | `vite-plus/test/node`    |
| `environments`, `snapshot` | `vite-plus/test/runtime` |

The `vite-plus/test/mocker` shim re-exports `@vitest/mocker`; migration still
uses this path because Vitest v5 has no corresponding entry.

Playwright and Preview provider paths and `browser/providers/*` aliases remain
available. WebDriverIO has no Vite+ shims. Migration restores its legacy aliases
to the community-maintained `@vitest/browser-webdriverio` package. Keep the
optional peer declaration synchronized with Vitest's dependency metadata.
The `plugins/*` compatibility paths mirror public exports of their named
standalone packages and retain upstream type declarations.

Removed runner, suite, expect-plugin, and internal module-runner paths have no
partial shim. Use `TestRunner` and `expect` from `vite-plus/test` where the root
API supports the old symbol. The migration reports uses without a replacement.
The resolver uses an explicit package allowlist, so standalone `@vitest/expect`,
deprecated `@vitest/ws-client`, and `@vitest/istanbul-lib-*` dependencies keep
their own project resolution.

Inline projects inherit the declaring config's Vite+ plugins. Independent
projects (`extends: false` or an external base) receive their own plugins.
Referenced configs that use `defineConfig` or `defineProject` receive the same
integration, including nested projects. Raw referenced configs retain upstream
resolution and its soft coverage-version warning when no Vite+ hook runs.

```typescript
// For each vitest export like "./node"
// Creates a shim file: dist/test/node.js
export * from 'vitest/node';

// For each @vitest/browser-* provider, two shim surfaces are projected:
//   dist/test/browser-playwright.js          (matches old wrapper path)
//   dist/test/browser/providers/playwright.js (alias path)
export * from '@vitest/browser-playwright';
```

Provider `.d.ts` shims are NOT bare re-exports — see the [Provider Type Identity](#why-provider-dts-shims-are-inlined) note below.

**Input**: resolved `vitest/package.json` exports plus each `@vitest/browser-*` package's exports (all resolved via `createRequire`)
**Output**: `dist/test/*.js`, `dist/test/*.d.ts`, updated `package.json` exports

## NAPI Targets

The CLI builds native bindings for the following platform targets:

| Target                       | Platform | Architecture | Output File                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin`       | macOS    | ARM64        | `vite-plus.darwin-arm64.node`     |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin`        | macOS    | x64          | `vite-plus.darwin-x64.node`       |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`  | Linux    | ARM64 glibc  | `vite-plus.linux-arm64-gnu.node`  |
| `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` | Linux    | ARM64 musl   | `vite-plus.linux-arm64-musl.node` |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`   | Linux    | x64 glibc    | `vite-plus.linux-x64-gnu.node`    |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`  | Linux    | x64 musl     | `vite-plus.linux-x64-musl.node`   |
| `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`    | Windows  | ARM64        | `vite-plus.win32-arm64-msvc.node` |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`     | Windows  | x64          | `vite-plus.win32-x64-msvc.node`   |

These targets are defined in `package.json` under the `napi.targets` field.

## Rolldown Native Binding Integration

The CLI package integrates with Rolldown at the native binding level, allowing vite-plus to ship as a self-contained package without requiring users to install separate `@rolldown/binding-*` packages.

### Conditional Compilation

Rolldown bindings are **optionally** compiled into the vite-plus native module via Cargo feature flags.

**In `binding/Cargo.toml`**:

```toml
[dependencies]
rolldown_binding = { workspace = true, optional = true }

[features]
rolldown = ["dep:rolldown_binding"]
```

**In `binding/src/lib.rs`**:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "rolldown")]
pub extern crate rolldown_binding;
```

### Build-Time Feature Activation

The rolldown feature is only enabled during release builds:

```typescript
// In build.ts
await cli.build({
  features: process.env.RELEASE_BUILD ? ['rolldown'] : void 0,
  release: process.env.VP_CLI_DEBUG !== '1',
});
```

**When `RELEASE_BUILD=1`**:

1. Enables the `rolldown` Cargo feature
2. Compiles `rolldown_binding` into the `.node` file
3. Extracts `napi.dtsHeader` from rolldown's package.json for type definitions
4. Prepends custom type definitions to the generated `.d.ts` file

### Why Conditional Compilation?

| Build Type                  | rolldown Feature | Use Case                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Development (`pnpm build`)  | Disabled         | Faster builds, smaller binaries         |
| Release (`RELEASE_BUILD=1`) | Enabled          | Full distribution with bundled rolldown |

### Module Specifier Rewriting

During release builds, the core package rewrites each supported `@rolldown/binding-*` import to the matching Vite+ platform package (see `packages/core/build-support/rewrite-rolldown-binding.ts`):

**Transformation examples**:

| Original Import                    | After Rewrite                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `@rolldown/binding-darwin-arm64`   | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-darwin-arm64`   |
| `@rolldown/binding-linux-x64-gnu`  | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-linux-x64-gnu`  |
| `@rolldown/binding-win32-x64-msvc` | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-win32-x64-msvc` |

This means:

1. The bundled rolldown code in `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core/rolldown` resolves native bindings through core's own declared optional dependencies (injected at publish time by `publish-native-addons.ts`)
2. Users don't need to install separate `@rolldown/binding-*` platform packages
3. The platform `.node` file contains both vite-plus task runner and rolldown bindings

### Native Binding Contents

When compiled with `RELEASE_BUILD=1`, the `.node` file contains:

| Component          | Source                             | Purpose                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `vt`               | `packages/cli/binding/src/lib.rs`  | Task runner session management |
| `rolldown_binding` | `rolldown/crates/rolldown_binding` | Rolldown bundler NAPI bindings |

### Export Chain

```
User imports 'vite-plus/rolldown'
  → packages/cli re-exports from @voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core/rolldown
    → packages/core/dist/rolldown/index.mjs
      → Native binding: @voidzero-dev/vite-plus-darwin-arm64
        (rewritten from @rolldown/binding-darwin-arm64)
        → vite-plus.darwin-arm64.node (contains rolldown_binding)
```

### Platform-Specific Publishing

Native bindings are published as separate platform packages for optimal install size:

| Platform          | Published Package                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| macOS ARM64       | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-darwin-arm64`     |
| macOS x64         | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-darwin-x64`       |
| Linux ARM64 glibc | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-linux-arm64-gnu`  |
| Linux ARM64 musl  | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-linux-arm64-musl` |
| Linux x64 glibc   | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-linux-x64-gnu`    |
| Linux x64 musl    | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-linux-x64-musl`   |
| Windows ARM64     | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-win32-arm64-msvc` |
| Windows x64       | `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-win32-x64-msvc`   |

These are automatically installed via `optionalDependencies` based on the user's platform. `publish-native-addons.ts` injects the exact-pinned entries into both `vite-plus` (via napi-rs prePublish) and `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` during publish; the committed package.json files carry none of them.

See `publish-native-addons.ts` for the publishing pipeline.

## Core Package Export Sync Details

### Why Shim Files?

The CLI package creates thin shim files that re-export from `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` rather than bundling the actual code. This approach:

1. **Enables drop-in replacement** - Users can replace `vite` with `vite-plus` without changing imports
2. **Keeps packages in sync** - No need to rebuild CLI when core package changes
3. **Reduces duplication** - No file copying, just re-exports
4. **Preserves module resolution** - Node.js resolves to the actual core package

**Note**: The `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core` package itself bundles multiple upstream projects (vite, rolldown, tsdown). See [Core Package Bundling](../core/BUNDLING.md) for details.

### Export Mapping (Core)

| Upstream Vite Export | CLI Package Export        | Description                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `vite/client`        | `vite-plus/client`        | Ambient types for HMR, CSS modules, assets |
| `vite/module-runner` | `vite-plus/module-runner` | SSR/Environment module runner              |
| `vite/internal`      | `vite-plus/internal`      | Internal APIs                              |
| `vite/dist/client/*` | `vite-plus/dist/client/*` | Client runtime files                       |
| `vite/types/*`       | `vite-plus/types/*`       | Type definitions                           |

### Type-Only Exports

For `./types/*` exports, shim files use `export type *` syntax (TypeScript 5.0+) to ensure only type information is re-exported:

```typescript
// dist/types/importMeta.d.ts
export type * from 'vite/types/importMeta.d.ts';
```

This is important because `./types/*` only exposes `.d.ts` files and should never include runtime code.

### Internal Types Blocking

The `./types/internal/*` export is set to `null` in package.json to block access to internal type definitions:

```json
"./types/internal/*": null,
"./types/*": { "types": "./dist/types/*" }
```

The `syncTypesDir()` helper skips the top-level `internal` directory when creating shims, since access is blocked at the exports level.

### Client Types (Triple-Slash Reference)

The `./client` export uses a triple-slash reference instead of a regular export because Vite's `client.d.ts` contains ambient type declarations (for CSS modules, assets, etc.) that should be globally available:

```typescript
// dist/client.d.ts
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
```

This allows TypeScript to pick up types like `import.meta.hot`, CSS module types, and asset imports without explicit imports.

---

## Test Package Export Sync Details

### Why Shim Files?

Instead of copying vitest's dist files, we create thin shim files that re-export from `vitest`. This approach:

1. **Keeps packages in sync** - No need to rebuild CLI when vitest is upgraded
2. **Reduces duplication** - No file copying, just re-exports
3. **Preserves module resolution** - Node.js resolves to the actual installed vitest

### Export Mapping (Test)

Every entry under vitest's own `exports` is shimmed under `./test/*` (wildcard exports and `./package.json` are skipped). The shim is purely a re-export — `vite-plus/test` and friends are aliases for the matching subpath of upstream `vitest`. Examples:

| Vitest Export    | CLI Package Export       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `vitest`         | `vite-plus/test`         |
| `vitest/browser` | `vite-plus/test/browser` |
| `vitest/node`    | `vite-plus/test/node`    |
| `vitest/config`  | `vite-plus/test/config`  |
| `vitest/runtime` | `vite-plus/test/runtime` |

The full set is regenerated on every build from the upstream vitest `package.json`, so the exact list tracks vitest itself.

In addition to vitest's own exports, the official browser providers have these aliases:

| Provider Package             | CLI Package Exports                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@vitest/browser-playwright` | `vite-plus/test/browser-playwright`, `vite-plus/test/browser/providers/playwright` |
| `@vitest/browser-preview`    | `vite-plus/test/browser-preview`, `vite-plus/test/browser/providers/preview`       |

Each provider's own subpaths (e.g. `./context`) are mirrored under both alias prefixes.

Browser-context runtime aliases re-export `vitest/browser`, the virtual entry used by Vitest v5. This applies to provider `/context` paths, `./test/browser/context`, `./test/context`, and `./test/plugins/browser-context`. Their declarations retain the upstream browser-context types and module augmentations. The upstream `@vitest/browser/context` JavaScript file is now an error stub, not the browser runtime.

`@vitest/browser` and `@vitest/browser-preview` are bundled runtime dependencies. Playwright stays an optional peer and a development dependency for shim generation. Migration keeps the Playwright provider in the user's dependencies, aligns it with bundled Vitest, and ensures its framework peer.

Vite+ 1.0 has no WebDriverIO exports or shims. Users import from the community-maintained `@vitest/browser-webdriverio` and manage its versions and peers. The optional peer declaration remains synchronized with Vitest's dependency metadata; the development dependency supports compatibility tests only. Migration restores legacy provider aliases to the community package and moves legacy runtime `/context` aliases to the shared `vite-plus/test/browser/context` entry.

#### Why provider d.ts shims are inlined

Provider `.d.ts` shims are NOT plain `export * from '@vitest/browser-playwright'` re-exports — they inline the upstream `.d.ts` content with `vitest/node` / `vitest/browser` / `@vitest/browser*` bare specifiers rewritten to relative paths inside `dist/test/`. The two private shims `dist/test/_at-vitest-browser.d.ts` and `dist/test/_at-vitest-browser/context.d.ts` re-export `@vitest/browser`/`@vitest/browser/context` and are referenced from those rewrites.

This avoids a pnpm-edge type-identity split: when the upstream `.d.ts` is loaded by reference (`export * from '@vitest/browser-playwright'`), TypeScript resolves its internal `import { BrowserProvider } from 'vitest/node'` through the provider package's own pnpm-edge, which can be a different vitest copy than the one a user's `vite.config.ts` sees through `vite-plus`. The mismatch produces two structurally identical but nominally distinct `BrowserProvider` types, so `provider: playwright()` fails the user's typecheck. Rewriting the specifiers routes every type import through vite-plus's own subpath shims, guaranteeing a single vitest identity across the user's whole config.

### Conditional Export Handling

The sync handles complex conditional exports with `import`/`require`/`node`/`types` conditions.

**Vitest's main export** (`"."`):

```json
".": {
  "import": { "types": "...", "node": "...", "default": "..." },
  "require": { "types": "...", "default": "..." }
}
```

**Becomes CLI package export** (`"./test"`):

```json
"./test": {
  "import": {
    "types": "./dist/test/index.d.ts",
    "node": "./dist/test/index.js",
    "default": "./dist/test/index.js"
  },
  "require": {
    "types": "./dist/test/index.d.cts",
    "default": "./dist/test/index.cjs"
  }
}
```

For each condition, appropriate shim files are created:

- `.js` for ESM imports
- `.cjs` for CommonJS requires
- `.d.ts` / `.d.cts` for type declarations

### Shim File Contents

**ESM shim** (`dist/test/browser.js`):

```javascript
export * from 'vitest/browser';
```

**CJS shim** (`dist/test/index.cjs`):

```javascript
module.exports = require('vitest');
```

**Type shim** (`dist/test/browser.d.ts`):

```typescript
import 'vitest/browser';
export * from 'vitest/browser';
```

Note: Type shims include a side-effect import to preserve module augmentations (e.g., `toMatchSnapshot` on the `Assertion` interface).

## Build Dependencies

| Package        | Purpose                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `@napi-rs/cli` | NAPI build toolchain for Rust    |
| `oxfmt`        | Code formatting for generated JS |
| `tsdown`       | TypeScript bundling              |

---

## Debug Mode

To build with debug (unoptimized) Rust bindings:

```bash
VP_CLI_DEBUG=1 pnpm build
```

This sets `release: false` in the NAPI build options, producing larger but faster-to-compile debug binaries.

---

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the CLI package (requires core package to be built first)
pnpm -C packages/cli build

# Build from monorepo root (builds all dependencies first)
pnpm build --filter vite-plus

# Debug build
VP_CLI_DEBUG=1 pnpm -C packages/cli build
```

## Package Exports

After building, the CLI package exports:

| Export Path                 | Description                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `.`                         | Main entry (CLI utilities)          |
| `./client`                  | Client types (ambient declarations) |
| `./module-runner`           | Vite module runner for SSR          |
| `./internal`                | Internal Vite APIs                  |
| `./dist/client/*`           | Client runtime files                |
| `./types/*`                 | Type definitions                    |
| `./bin`                     | CLI binary entry point              |
| `./binding`                 | NAPI native binding                 |
| `./test`                    | Test package main entry             |
| `./test/browser`            | Browser testing utilities           |
| `./test/browser-playwright` | Playwright integration              |
| `./test/plugins/*`          | Plugin shims for pnpm overrides     |
| `./package.json`            | Package metadata                    |

See `package.json` for the complete list of exports.

## Technical Reference

### Build Flow

```
1. buildWithTsdown()         tsdown bundle -> dist/*.js, dist/*.d.ts
2. buildNapiBinding()        Rust -> binding/*.node (per platform)
3. syncCorePackageExports()  Read core pkg dist -> dist/client/, dist/types/
   ├── createClientShim()        Triple-slash reference for ./client
   ├── createModuleRunnerShim()  JS + types for ./module-runner
   ├── createInternalShim()      JS + types for ./internal
   ├── syncClientDir()           Shims for ./dist/client/*
   └── syncTypesDir()            Type-only shims for ./types/*
4. syncTestPackageExports()  Read test pkg exports -> dist/test/*
   ├── createShimForExport()     Generate shim files
   ├── createConditionalShim()   Handle import/require conditions
   └── updateCliPackageJson()    Update exports in package.json
```

### Key Constants

```typescript
// Core package name for Vite compatibility exports
const CORE_PACKAGE_NAME = '@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core';
const CORE_IMPORT_SPECIFIER = 'vite';

// Test package name for re-exports (vitest itself, not a bundled wrapper)
const TEST_PACKAGE_NAME = 'vitest';
```

### Package.json Exports Management

The `exports` field in `package.json` has two categories: **manual** and **automated**.

#### Manual exports

All non-`./test*` exports are manually maintained in `package.json`. These fall into two groups:

**CLI-native exports** — point to CLI's own bundled TypeScript (built by `buildWithTsdown()` via tsdown):

| Export           | Description                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `.`              | Main entry (CLI utilities) |
| `./bin`          | CLI binary entry point     |
| `./binding`      | NAPI native binding        |
| `./lint`         | Lint utilities             |
| `./pack`         | Pack utilities             |
| `./package.json` | Package metadata           |

**Core shim exports** — point to shim files auto-generated by `syncCorePackageExports()` that re-export from `@voidzero-dev/vite-plus-core`. The shim files are regenerated on each build, but the `package.json` entries themselves are manual:

| Export               | Description                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./client`           | Triple-slash reference for ambient type declarations (CSS modules, etc) |
| `./module-runner`    | Vite module runner for SSR/environments                                 |
| `./internal`         | Internal Vite APIs                                                      |
| `./dist/client/*`    | Client runtime files                                                    |
| `./types/internal/*` | Blocked (`null`) to prevent access to internal types                    |
| `./types/*`          | Type-only re-exports                                                    |

**Note**: The core package's own exports (which the shims point to) are generated upstream by `packages/tools/src/sync-remote-deps.ts`. See [Core Package Bundling](../core/BUNDLING.md) for details.

#### Automated exports (`./test/*`)

All `./test*` exports are fully managed by `syncTestPackageExports()`. The build script:

1. Reads vitest's `package.json` exports (resolved via `createRequire`)
2. Creates shim files in `dist/test/`
3. Removes old `./test*` exports from `package.json`
4. Merges in newly generated test exports
5. Relies on the existing `dist` entry to include the generated `dist/test` shims
