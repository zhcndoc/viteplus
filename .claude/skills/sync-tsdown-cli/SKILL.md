# Sync tsdown CLI Options with vp pack

Compare the upstream `tsdown` CLI options with `vp pack` (defined in `packages/cli/src/pack-bin.ts`) and sync any differences.

## Steps

1. Run `npx tsdown --help` from `packages/cli/` to get tsdown's current CLI options
2. Read `packages/cli/src/pack-bin.ts` to see vp pack's current options
3. Compare and add any new tsdown options to `pack-bin.ts` using the existing cac `.option()` pattern
4. If tsdown removed options, do NOT remove them from `pack-bin.ts` -- instead add a code comment like `// NOTE: removed from tsdown CLI in vX.Y.Z` above the option so reviewers can decide whether to follow up
5. Preserve intentional differences:
   - `-c, --config` is intentionally commented out (vp pack uses vite.config.ts)
   - `--env-prefix` has a different default (`['VITE_PACK_', 'TSDOWN_']`)
6. Verify with `pnpm --filter vite-plus build-ts` and `vp pack -h`
7. If new parameters were added, add a corresponding PTY snapshot case under `crates/vite_cli_snapshots/tests/cli_snapshots/fixtures/` to verify the new option works correctly
